## Description

This is proof-of-concept project, that theoretically should "mine" public cloud 
links from the internet for further investigation.

## Usage

Script written for Python 3.12, but should work on other versions.

To install necessary requirements, run:
```
python3 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can use ```run.py``` or full command to config and run the scraper:
```
python3 run.py -w <num of workers>
```
